# data_analytics
We clean, pre-process and analyze data in this repository


This dataset was originally put together for the Yelp Dataset Challenge which is a chance for students to conduct research or analysis on Yelp's data and share their discoveries. In the dataset you'll find information about businesses across 11 metropolitan areas in four countries.
WE use a small subset of the dataset made available by Yelp.
